            <h4>Week 10:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I learned a new feature in JavaScript ES6 called template literals/template strings/string interpolation.  With template literal syntax, I could write using backticks around the entire string and ${} around the variables being interpolated.</li>
                <li>I learned about the object data type, which is the only data type that is not considered a primitive.  It is a data structure for a collection of data than a singular piece of data.</li>
                <li>Objects can have properties and methods - which are variables and functions that belong to that object.  We can also add custom methods to objects.</li>
                <li>I learned about the "this" keyword with objects in JavaScript.</li> 
                <li>I learned about JavaScript classes, which are templates for objects and can be used to create multiple instances of the same kind of object.</li> 
                <li>I learned about adding default properties with class constructors, and class methods to create class instances (objects) with the new keyword.</li>
                <li>I learned about class inheritance, where we could create child classes based on parent classes.  The child class inherits the properties and methods of the parent class.  A child class can also add its own properties and methods without affecting the parent class.  We could also make a child class from a parent class using the extends keyword.</li>
                <li>The super method is a special method for child constructors to pass those properties that are inherited from the parent class to be initialized in the constructor there.  You must use it with inherited properties, properties that are defined in the parent class' constructor.</li>
                <li>We reviewed arrays and array methods, including the meaning of the terms higher-order function and callback function.  A higher order function is a function that takes another function as an argument, or returns a function as a return value.  A callback function is a function that is passed into a higher order function as an argument, then used inside it (called back).</li>
                <li>I learned about 3 advanced array methods - maps, filter, and reduce - which are higher order functions, each taking a callback function as an argument.  The callback function is defined by the programmer and is usually in the form of an arrow function.  None of these methods are mutator methods (they do not change the original array).  Instead, they can be classified as iteration methods (they iterate through the array as many times as the array length).</li>
                <li>These 3 array methods all have return values, although not all array methods do.  Map and filter both return a new array, while reduce returns a single value and not an array.</li>
                <li>Map iterates through an array and performs a given callback function on every item in the array.  Map returns a new array of the same length as the old array, but will typically chagne the array items' values.</li>
                <li>Filter takes a callback function that specifies a filtering condition, iterates through an array, and returns a new, filtered array.  Filter will return a new array, and the length (number of items) in the array may changed, but the values of the filtered array items will not change.</li>
                <li>Reduce will not return an array at all.  Instead, it will return a single value.  When working with array of objects, we would need to set an initial value for reduce.</li>
                <li>I also learned about creating arrays of objects using object literals.  I learned about using array of objects with the filter method and reduce method.  Specifically for the reduce method, it is important to set an inital value with an array of objects.</li>
                <li>I learned about method chaining, which means running multiple methods in a single statement by use of return values.  Methods must have return values in order to be chained, which map, filter, and reduce all do.  It is important to note that map and filter return new arrays while reduce returns a single value.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Challenges:</strong> There were 6 challenges this week, which can be found in my CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/wvMbzpo">Template Literals</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/pogmEGV">Objects</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/JjGqzVp">Class Inheritance</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/PoZrjMg">Map</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/oNbrezP">Filter</a>, and <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/yLedoKo">Reduce</a>.</li>

            <h4>Week 11:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I learned about the main difference between libaries and frameworks, which have to do with a concept called inversion of control - you call libraries, but frameworks call you (your code).  Libraries: you have control - you can call the library when you want to use it; frameworks: the framework has control and calls your code when needed.</li>
                <li>I was introduced to React, which is a library.  Some of its defining features are that it takes a declarative, component-based approach; it is designed for speed, simplicity, and scalability; and it plays well with other technologies.</li>
                <li>I learned about JSX, which is a syntactic extension to JavaScript created to help write front-end code faster.</li>
                <li>JSX is syntactic sugar of JavaScript, or a preprocessor language for JavaScript.  We could write our code in one way, then it gets compiled to regular JavaScript on its way to the browser.  JSX syntax is very close to HTML, with some differences.  For examples, className instead of class, htmlFor insted of For - because class and for already have meaning in JavaScripts.</li> 
                <li>We could embed JavaScript expressions inside JSX using curly braces {}.  When an element has no content, we could write it as a self-closing tag in JSX.</li> 
                <li>There are import and export keywords in JavaScript allowing files to share data with each other.  The shared data can be objects, primitive, and functions (including classes).  Two kinds of exports: name and default - one file can have many named exports but only one default export.</li>
                <li>I was introduced to React components, which are similar to functions - repeatable blocks of code.  Like a function, we could define a React component with one syntax then call it with another syntax.</li>
                <li>I learned that there are 2 ways to define React components - Class component and functional component.</li>
                <li>For Class component, use the class keyword, along with extends Component, to define a class component.  Component names must be capitalized and contain a return statement - for class components, the return must be wrapped in a render () method.  That return must contain a single React element - which can have other elements and components nested inside it.  Render a component like an HTML tag, with the first letter capitalized, typically (not always) self-closing.</li>
                <li>I practiced lifting state up from one component to its parent component, then passed the state information down as props, changing references from state to props as appropriate.</li>
                <li>I learned to set up Reactstrap Card components and added functionality to display more information when user clicks.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Challenges:</strong> There were 3 challenges this week, which can be found in my CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/WNrVaOO">JSX and State</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/pogMqjJ">Constructing Lists</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/WNwebKQ">Passing Props</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Project:</strong> I added a new component and used the Card component and the Bootstrap unstyled list component in my React Nucamp website, which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/joannahanchang/React-Project-Setup">Github</a>.</li></li>
            </ul>     
        </section>

        <section id="week12">
            <h4>Week 12:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I learned about JavaScript object destructuring assignment syntax, which was introduced in ES6.  It gives a shortcut for accessing properties inside objects, or items inside arrays, and putting them inside new variables.  Object destructuring is basically a shorthand to more easily pull properties out of objects and assign them to variables or as arguments for function parameters.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to container components and presentational components.  Container components fetch and manage state data, pass data to presentational components for rendering, and do not render UI.  Presentational components render UI – markup, styles – based on props passed to them.  They do not maintain their own state – only light UI state if any.</li>
            <li>I practiced structuring the Nucamp website app into presentational and container components by creating a new container component named Main and moving the campsites data into its state, and restructuring the Directory component as a purely presentational component, among other updates.</li>
            <li>Functional components are written just like a function as a function declaration, function expression, or error function.  Typically, they are written as function declarations or arrow functions.  They need to accept props as an argument.  Like class components, they will always return at least one react element, but they do not use the render method around the return, and they will never have a constructor method.  Another difference is that when you refer to props inside a functional component, we do not use the this keyword.</li> 
            <li>In sum, functional components have no render() method, no constructor method; cannot hold state, and cannot use lifecycle methods.  But a recent version of React (v. 16.8) introduced an addition called hooks that provides ways for functional components to access state and lifecycle methods.</li> 
            <li>I learned about converting class components and methods to functional components.  I practiced converting the Nucamp website components and methods to functional components, and gained practice in using object destructuring syntax in function parameter lists.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to the React virtual DOM.  It is much faster and easier to update the virtual DOM than the browser DOM – no re-rendering of graphical display.  Any DOM changes made with React are first made to the virtual DOM.</li>
            <li>React uses a process called reconciliation to compare and find differences between (“diff”)  the virtual DOM and the browser DOM.  Sophisticated reconciliation engine named Fiber looks for what has changed, then figures out the most optimized way to patch the browser DOM with the changes with minimal re-rendering, such as by combining updates in batches instead of multiple single changes.</li>
            <li>I updated my Nucamp website React application to integrate a Header and Footer component, along with installing Font-Awesome and Boostrap-Social libraries to use their icon kits and adding new CSS rules.</li>
            <li>I learned to use React Fragments.</li>
            <li>Unlike in Bootstrap, in React, we will not have multiple HTML pages.  Instead, we will use React to build a Single Page App (SPA), launched from a single HTML page.</li>
            <li>A routing library such as React router is crucial to an SPA.  React router is a popular third-party library in the React ecosystem.  It is a collection of router, route matching, and navigation components.  It handles routing requests to navigate to different views, generate unique, bookmarkable URL for each view, and handles browser history – ability to move back and forward.  Some React Router components include BrowserRouter, Route, Redirect, Switch, Link, and NavLink.</li>
            <li>I learned to install React Router and set it up to route views within the NuCamp website.  First, I learned to wrap the root component of the site, App, inside the BrowserRouter component.  Then I used Route components within a Switch grouping in the Main component to define the various routes, and set up NavLink and Link components to direct to those routes from the Header and Footer components.  I also set up a new component, Home, to render the default view when the website is loaded without a specific route.</li>
            <li>SPA is a one page that locally downloads all the front-end application code for the website (HTML, CSS, JS).  When switching views, the application intelligently handles the front-end rendering, making minimum requests to the server (for database data, for example), and re-rendering only what is changed.</li>
            <li>Pros of SPA include: much faster due to fewer server requests, streamlined development: easier to divide back end and front end tasks, easily reuse back end code for mobile development, and easier to debug in browser.</li>
            <li>Cons of SPA include: Search engines can have trouble indexing SPAs (though they are improving), so SPAs are typically best for websites behind a login that would not be indexed anyway, dependent on JavaScript being enabled in browser, initial download of application code can be slow, and must be careful of memory leaks.</li>
            <li>SPA does not use traditional browser navigation of going to new HTML page for each view, and there are concerns such as clicking on links to render different views, using Back/Forward buttons for browser history, etc.</li>
            <li>I practiced using React router route parameters to render the view of a specific campsite by its ID number and adding breadcrumbs among other items.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Challenges:</strong> There were 3 challenges this week, which can be found in my CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/ExKjPRV">React Components and Object Destructuring</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/ZEWGWmK">Lifting State Up and Function Components</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/abNvbVa">React Router Params</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Project:</strong> I integrated the About Component into a single page application, rendered the details of a given partner using the Reactstrap Medai component, etc. in my React Nucamp website, which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/joannahanchang/React-Project-Setup">Github</a>.</li></li>

            <h4>Week 13:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I learned about Computed Property Names, which allow us to pass in variables for use as property names when initializing an object.</li>
                <li>The spread syntax can be used with both arrays and object and lets us pull out (“spread”) a copy of what is inside the array or object.  This can help combine multiple objects to create a new object.  We can also use it to create copy of an existing object while updating specific properties of that object.</li>
                <li>I was introduced to ternary operator (also known as the conditional operator) is so-called because it is the only JavaScript operator with 3 operands (ternary means “composed of three-parts.”):</li> 
                <li>condition to be evaluated ? expression to execute if condition is truthy : expression to execute if condition is falsy.</li> 
                <li>I was exposed to regular expressions or usually abbreviated as regex or regexp. They are special text strings used to define a string search pattern in an efficient, powerful way.  Regexes are supported in most programming languages, including Perl, Python, Java, Ruby, and yes, JavaScript.</li>
                <li>I learned about React controlled forms, or form values directly tied to the state of the React component that the form is in.  React controls the form state, no conflicts between HTML form state and React: React is the “single source of truth.”  Any changes to the form fields immediately reflected in component’s state, can easily be responded to with JavaScript (such as form validation, showing error messages, etc.).</li>
                <li>I also set up JavaScript functions to validate form input, then use the FormFeedback and Input components from Reactstrap to display any error messages.</li>
                <li>Controlled vs. uncontrolled forms: controlled forms tie form component values directly to the state of the parent component.  They require a lot of initial set up, but are the recommended way to set up forms in React.  Uncontrolled components are an alternative – quicker to set up, easier if we are trying to integrate React code with non-React code.</li>
                <li>HTML forms naturally keep their own internal state, tracked by the DOM, separate from React.  For controlled forms, React controls form state.  For uncontrolled forms, DOM continues to handle the form state, React just retrieves the data when needed – the form elements within the DOM act as the single source of truth.</li>
                <li>I was introduced to MVC design pattern, a widespread approach to structuring the front end of both desktop GUIs and web application.  The key concept is separation of concerns.  It facilitates independent development, testing, maintenance of different parts of an app.  The presentation layer is divided into 3 parts: Model, View, and Controller.</li>
                <li>The Model part handles application state and logic; View presents information to user; Controller mediates between model and view.</li>
                <li>Although the MVC pattern is very common in programming, React does not use MVC.  React state management is often handled with a newer design pattern called Flux.  A state management library called Redux owes some of its parentage to Flux.</li>
                <li>Flux is unidirectional (one-way) data flow and it separates its concerns into Action-Dispatcher-Store-View.</li>
                <li>JavaScript libraries that implement Flux include Flummox, Alt, and Redux.</li>
                <li>There are 3 fundamental principles of Redux: single source of truth, state is read-only, and changes are made with pure functions.</li>
                <li>I practiced using Redux and react-redux-form library.  I used its LocalForm and Control components to convert the form in the Contact component to use the Redux store as its single source of truth for form state.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Challenges:</strong> There were 5 challenges this week, which can be found in my CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/YzqqaRJ">Spread Syntax</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/XWddqJV">Ternary Operator</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/abNNGWa">Regular Expressions</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/LYNNBVL">Toggling Modals</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/VwaKjQM">Convert HTML to React</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Project:</strong> I included a new component named CommentForm and used React-Redux-Form to provide and validate a form for users to submit comments in my React Nucamp website, which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/joannahanchang/React-Project-Setup">Github</a>.</li></li>

            <h4>Week 14:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Plain JavaScript objects contain payloads of information to be sent to the Redux store.  Actions are the only way that updates get sent to the store.  The only required property for an action is type – the type will be a unique String.  Best practice: Gather all action types into a separate module.</li>
                <li>React components will dispatch an action in response to some user interaction – e.g. loading a new view, clicking a button, etc.  In react-redux, we will never dispatch the action directly – we will supply an argument called mapDispatchToProps to the connect() function, which will call the store’s dispatch method for us.</li>
                <li>Whenever an action is dispatched, a new action object must be created.  Typically, we will write a function called an action creator that will create the object in a consistent error-free way.</li> 
                <li>For every action, we will create: 1. An action type defined as a String constant, 2. An action creator, a function that returns the action object and has a type property, plus any data (payload) to send to the store to update it.  Then we will connect each action to React component using the connect() function and a mapDispatchToProps argument.  Then, every time an action is dispatched, the Redux store will check all its reducers for a matching action type, then run the code for that action type, which will then update the state.</li> 
                <li>I practiced setting up a file to hold action types, as well as a file to hold action creators, and setting up an action to be dispatched to the comments reducer to update the Redux store.  I learned to then dispatch that action through setting up a mapDispatchToProps for use in the connect() function.</li>
                <li>I learned about synchronous code and asynchronous code: synchronous code is when everything happens in order, app wait until a piece of code is finished before continuing.  Asynchronous code starts something, then continue with the program without waiting for it to finish, result is dealt with later.  A common asynchronous call is when a client requests data from server and must wait for a response before using data.</li>
                <li>Redux Middleware can wrap around dispatch and insert operations before action reaches reducer: logging, making async calls, crash reporting, stopped an action, dispatching other actions, etc.  Middleware can be chained, so multiple middleware libraries can be used in sequence.  Redux applyMiddleware() function, passed as parameter to createStore() function.</li>
                <li>Redux Thunk is the most useful Middleware libraries.  “Thunk” is a programming technique where we wrap a function inside another function to delay its executive.  This technique is used in Redux Thunk to inject extra operations into an action creator.  Action creators normally return an action (object).</li>
                <li>A network protocol is a set of rules for how two networked systems will talk to each other.  Rules such as: what kind of data will be exchanged, how the data will be formatted, how the systems will respond to certain types of requests, etc.</li>
                <li>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a foundation of data communication on the web.  It is considered an application layer protocol.  The browser sends request to the server via HTTP request, and the server responds to the request via HTTP response.</li>
                <li>I learned about data formats such as JSON and XML.</li>
                <li>REST or Representational State Transfer, is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating Web services.  Web Services are resources available over the Web.  There are two basic types: SOAP web services and RESTful web services.</li>
                <li>6 defining constraints of rest – 1. Client-server separation, 2. Statelessness, 3. Uniform Interface, 4. Cacheable, 5. Layered System, 6. Code on Demand.</li>
                <li>9 HTTP Methods (VERBS) – POST (CRETAE), GET (READ), PUT (UPDATE), DELETE (DELETE), HEAD, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, CATCH.</li>
                <li>I learned about JavaScript promises, which has 3 states: pending, fulfilled (or resolved), and rejected.</li>
                <li>Web APIs provide code constructs (objects, methods, etc.) that are not technically part of JavaScript.   It is built into browsers by default, so we can use them in client-side JavaScript.</li>
                <li>I practiced fetching from server, fetching handling errors, and fetching post comment.</li>
                <li>I learned about React-Transition-Group, which composes of Transition, CSSTransition, SwitchTransition, and TransitionGroup.</li>
                <li>Cretae-react-app comes with a utility that can handle all the concatenation, minification, uglification, compression, etc. with Webpack.  Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.  When webpack processes the application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module the project needs and generates one or more bundles.</li>
