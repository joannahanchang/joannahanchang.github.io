            <h4>Week 5:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I used NPM to install the necessary dependencies, and modified the package.json file to use lite-server.</li>
                <li>I learned about mobile-first web development in relation to Bootstrap, andthe approach of designing for the smallest screen adn working our way up.</li>
                <li>I learned about the use of the viewport meta tag along with CSS3 media queries and breakpoints in order to dynamically change the display of the webpage depending on the viewport width.</li>
                <li>I learned about the Bootstrap Grid system and that we could use it to create flexible layouts.  We could use either auto-layout or explicitly numbered columns to set the widths of all the columns in a row.</li> 
                <li>I also learned about using the built-in Boostrap breakpoints to set up different column classes based on teh viewport size.</li> 
                <li><strong>Code Challenge:</strong> There was 1 challenge this week, which can be found in my CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/GRorWVO">Bootstrap Grid</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Project:</strong> I started building the About Us page for the Bootstrap Nucamp website, which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/joannahanchang/Bootstrap-Project-Setup">Github</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Project:</strong> In addition to the Bootstrap Nucamp website, I also started working on my personal Boostrap project called YouDance, which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/joannahanchang/YouDance">Github</a>.</li>

            <h4>Week 7:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>This week, I learned about Bootstrap JavaScript components, which make use of JavaScript for their functionality, but do not require to be written in JavaScript. We could use HTML5 custom data-* attributes that Bootstrap has defined in their code to access the JavaScript functionality.</li>
                <li>The Bootstrap JavaScript components that are built with, or extended via JavaScript plugins include collapse and accordion, tooltips, modals, and carousels.</li>
                <li>We reviewed JavaScript this week.</li>
                <li>The 8 types of JavaScript as of the most recent ECMAScript standard are: number, string, boolean, undefined, null, object, symbol, and BigInt.</li>
                <li>We went over let vs. const. var, truthy vs. falsy, JavaScript operators, if/elseif/else, switch statement, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Challenge:</strong> There was a code challenge this week where we were asked to change the layout, Bootstrap CSS component classes, and colors to our Bootstrap Nucamp website.  I made 4 changes as shown below: carousel images from rectangle to oval shape, carousel border to complement the oval shape, caousel caption from rectangle to oval shape, and a pink background color showing up when one hovers to the log-in modal.</li>

                <li><strong>Code Challenge:</strong> There was another code challenge this week, which can be found in my CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/wvMrNWa">Bootstrap Radio Button Group</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Project:</strong> Continuing from last week, I worked on the Home page for the Bootstrap Nucamp website, which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/joannahanchang/Bootstrap-Project-Setup">Github</a>.</li>

            <h4>Week 8:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I learned that the JavaScript used in Bootstrap is through a popular JS library called jQuery.</li>
                <li>A couple examples of using jQuery is changing the carousel cycle interval and add play/pause functionality on the buttons, and modifying jQuery script so that when the button is clicked, it will change from play to pause or vice versa.</li>
                <li>We learned about Sass as the CSS preprocessor that is used to write the source CSS code for Bootstrap 4 and it is useful if we want to theme Bootstrap or customize its source.  Overall, CSS preprocessors can make it easier to write and maintain large, complex stylesheets.</li>
                <li>There are two variants of Sass - Sass (.sass) and Scss (.scss) - there are a few syntactic differences but their functionality is the same.</li>
                <li>I practiced writing Scss codes to incorporate variables and nesting.</li>
                <li>I installed the Node Scss package to compile .scss to .css.</li>
                <li>I learned about NPM scripts, which are basically scripts to automate repetitive tasks, delete temporary files and folders, etc.</li>
                <li>I added an NPM script in package.json to automate compilation.  Specific thing I did include: moving jQuery script for the carousel to an external JavaScript file, installing the onchange module to enable my project to watch for changes to its files, installing the parallel shell module to enable my project to run multiple NPM scripts in parallel, and watching for any changes to my Sass file and automatically compile it to css.</li>
                <li>With regard to automating the process of building a distribution folder by writing NPM scripts: stored copies of all font-awesome icon files, compressed and minified images, minified and uglified code files, cleaned up the distribution folder, and generated the distribution files with an NPM command.</li>
                <li>We reviewed JavaScript and the use of while loops and do...while loops, for loops, and arrays.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Challenges:</strong> There were 2 code challenges this week, which can be found in my CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/LYGQxoP">Bootstrap and jQuery</a>, and <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/xxZWONM">JS Review - Loops and Arrays</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Project:</strong> Continuing from last week, I worked on the Home page for the Bootstrap Nucamp website.  Completed version can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/joannahanchang/Bootstrap-Project-Setup">Github</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Project:</strong> I continued to work on my personal Boostrap project called YouDance, which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/joannahanchang/YouDance">Github</a>.</li>

            <h4>Week 9:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>This week, we reviewed JavaScript.</li>
                <li>We reviewed how to write and use JavaScript function declarations.  Function hoisting means that before any JavaScript is executed, the code is first scanned for function declarations and any that are found are "hoisted" to the top of their scope.  This means that we can use functions that were created with function declarations before we get to them in the code.</li>
                <li>We reviewed the use of events in JavaScript, primarily onevent handlers and event listeners.</li>
                <li>We learned the use of JavaScript function expressions, or ways to write functions inline in expressions.  This can be useful including being able to use a function as an argument for another function (which is known as a callback function).</li>
                <li>We also learned about the differences between anonymous and named function expressions, as well as that function expressions are not hoisted.</li>
                <li>We learned about the new ES6 arrow functions, which are a more compact version of function expressions, are frequently used as callback functions, and will be used very frequently in React.</li>
                <li>We reviewed the differences between let vs. const vs. var.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Challenges:</strong> There were 3 code challenges this week, which can be found in my CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/vYLrwyK">JS - Arrow Function Writing Drills</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/GRoGaEW">JS - MicroTweet</a>, and <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/dyGKBWZ">JS - Fix Me</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Project:</strong> I learned about a programming algorithm called binary search and used my Bootstrap and JavaScript knowledge to improve a number-guessing game using binary search, update the Bootstrap UI, and write JavaScript to add a reset button, as well as fix broken behavior.  The project is saved in my Codepen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/jOWQOap">JavaScript Binary Search Number Guessing Game.</a>
                <li><strong>Personal Project:</strong> I completed my personal Boostrap project called YouDance, which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/joannahanchang/YouDance">Github</a>.</li>
