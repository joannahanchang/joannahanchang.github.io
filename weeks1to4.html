            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I received an overview about HTML vs. CSS vs. JavaScript, web design vs. web development, and front-end vs. back-end vs. full stack development.</li>
                <li>I learned that developers package reusable code as open-resource libraries and frameworks and share with other developers.</li>
                <li>I installed and tested Visual Code St udio and its live server extension.</li>
                <li>With regard to HTML, I learned about hyperlinks, anchor element, image element, video element, and relative vs. absolute paths, etc.</li> 
                <li><strong>Project:</strong> Below is my very first project I created using HTML!</li>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I learned about the history of HTML and the World Wide Web.</li>
                <li>I played around with Codepen.io, a code playground that I would be using throughout this NuCamp bootcamp.</li>
                <li>With regard to HTML, I practiced setting up HTML tables and creating forms.</li>
                <li>I was introduced to CSS, which could be added to a webpage using inline styles, an internal stylesheet, and an external stylesheet.</li> 
                <li>I refreshed my memory regarding the 3 kinds of selectors - element/type, class, and ID.</li>
                <li>I realized that inline styles could also be considered a kind of selector, and they have the highest level of specificity.</li>
                <li>I learned that there are different specificity point values, where inline styles get the highest number, followed by ID selector, class selector, and element/type selector.</li>
                <li>I learned more about advanced selectors, including group selectors, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors, and combinators.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Challenges:</strong> There were 3 code challenges this week, and they can be found in my CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/KKdEogE">HTML Tables</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/VwvNZmZ">Fix This Form</a>, and <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/bGVyRWL">CSS Selectors and Specificity</a>.</li>

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I was introduced to JavaScript, which is not related to the Java programming language and it is case sensitive.</li>
                <li>I learned that I would be learning about vanilla JavaScript before delving into JavaScript-based technologies: React, React Native, Express.js, Node.js, etc. in this bootcamp.</li>
                <li>While there are more data types in JavaScript, the lesson focused on these: number, string, boolean, null, and undefined.</li>
                <li>I learned about variable declaration (using let, const, and var), assignment, and initialization.</li>  
                <li>I learned to use let for variables where the values could not be reassigned, and use const for variables where the values will not be reassigned.</li>
                <li>Pre-ES6, JavaScript only had one variable declaration keyword called var.  Let and const were introduced to correct some issues with the way var works.</li> 
                <li>I learned about defining, calling, and returning functions, as well as about using parameters and arguments.</li>
                <li>If statements were introduced: if, if...else, if...else if...else </li>
                <li>If statements check for whether a condition is truthy or falsy.  A non-Boolean value that would be true if converted to Boolean is considered truthy; likewise, a non-Boolean value that would be false if converted to Boolean is falsy.</li>
                <li>Another conditional statement introduced was the switch statement, which is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.  This is a good solution for long, nested if/else statements.</li>
                <li>I learned two types of comparison operators, equality and relational.  Equality operators refer to strict/loose equality/inequality.  Relational operators include greater/less than, and greater/less than or equal to. </li>
                <li>Common logical operators in JavaScript include &&, ||, and !.  && and || are binary, while ! is unary.  && returns the last truthy value if both operands are truthy; if either operand is falsy, then && returns the first falsy value.  || returns the first truthy value; if neither operand is truthy, then it will return the last falsy value. ! is a logical not and !! is the double not operator.</li>
                <li>Additional operators include addition assignment operators (+=), subtraction assignment operator (-=), increment operator (++), and decrement operator (--).  Addition and subtraction assignment operators are binary, while increment and decrement operators are unary.</li>
                <li>Loops are a way to repeat a block of code, and I learned about while loops and do...while loops this week.  While loops evaluate a condition that you set, and it will continue to loop as long as the condition evaluates as true.  With the while loop, the condition is evaluated first, so if the condition is false in the beginning, the code inside the block never executes.  With the do...while loop, the loop block executes once before evaluating the condition - so even if the condition is false, the code inside the block will always execute at least once.</li>
                <li>I learned 7 different types of array methods: shift, unshift, join, includes, and indexOf.  Shift removes an item from the beginning of an array, while unshift adds one more items to the beginning of an array.  Join takes all items in an array anda returns a string containing those items.  Includes is used to check if an item exists inside an array, and will return true or false.  IndexOf also checks if an item is in an array, but returns the index of the item if it exists in the array.</li>
                <li>I learned about the math global object and math.random and math.floor to help generate random numbers.  Math.random()*6 for example can generate a number between 0-6, but not including 6.  Math.floor removes all digits to the right of the decimal point from a number.  If we want to generate a random number between 1-6 rather than 0-5, we can add 1 to the result: const randomInteger = Math.floor(Math.random()*6)+1.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Challenges:</strong> There were 2 code challenges this week, which can be found in my CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/bGVXKQd">Variables and Functions Practice</a>and <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/jOWNOww">Switch</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Project:</strong> I built a <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/jOWJoJO">Number Guessing Game</a> using JavaScript, including functions, variables, arrays, operators, if statements, do...while loops, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Week 4:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I learned the difference bewteen for looks and while loops: for loops are like while loops, but with built-in support for an incrementing iterator.  It is in this format: for(initialization; condition; final expression){.</li>
                <li>For...of loops works with arrays and other iterables (data structures that contain lists of items that can be iterated over).  It can be expressed as: for (const/let variableName of arrayName) {.</li>
                <li>Loops can be controlled in the form of break or continue.  Break statement will immediately exit a loop, and continue statement will immediately skip to the next iteration of the loop.</li>
                <li>I learned more array methods this week, including concat, sort, reverse, slice, and splice (which can abe used for inserting, adding to, or removing items from an array at any point, not only the beginning or the end.</li> 
                <li>String methods include indexOf, includes, slice, toLowerCase, toUpperCase, and split.</li>
                <li>I learned about DOM, the Document Object Model providing an interface between JavaScript and HTML.  According to W3 school, it is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents.  It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.  A tree graph example would be html at the top (root node/parent node of head and body) -> head and body in the middle (child nodes of html).  Head and body in this case are also sibling nodes.</li>
                <li>As mentioned in the previous point, node relationship properties could include parentNode, firstChild, lastChild, nextSibling, previousSibling, and childNodes.  We can use to reference nodes in relation to each other.</li>
                <li>4 ways to locate nodes are: traversing the DOM, getElementsByTagName, getElementById, querySelector.</li>
                <li>4 ways to create and adding nodes are: createElement, createTextNode, insertBefore, and appendChild. </li>
                <li>3 ways to remove nodes are: remove, removeChild, and firstElementChild.</li>
                <li>Nodes can also be cloned using cloneNode and cloneNode(true).</li>
                <li>A few mouse events include onclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, and onmouseout.</li>
                <li>We can also set time events using setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, and clearInterval.</li>
                <li>Events can be added or removed using JavaScript via addEventListener and removeEventListener.  One advantage of addEventListener over other ways of adding event handlers is that we can use it to add more than one handler function to the same event, on the same element.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Challenge:</strong> There was 1 code challengeq this week, which can be found in my CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/XWXbzYM">Arrays Practice</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Project:</strong> I built a <a href="https://codepen.io/joannahanchang/pen/vYLPqMo?editors=1100">Matching Game</a> using DOM manipulation, adding event listeners, etc.</li>
